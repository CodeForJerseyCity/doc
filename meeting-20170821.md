# Meeting 2017-08-21 20:00

## Agenda
_Consider how to go about the following items._

### Consider Brian's suggestions
- _Stay as a Brigade of Code for America, or become something
  separate. Brian's argument for this comes from his previous
  experience of partnerships, and getting funding._
- _Financial issues such as funding, paying developers._

### Updating web presence
- _<https://www.meetup.com/Code-For-Jersey-City/>_
- _<https://twitter.com/CodeForJC>_
- _<https://github.com/CodeForJerseyCity>_
- _codeforjc.org (stale link)_

### Engaging with meetup members
- _Code of Conduct_
    - _<https://github.com/CodeForJerseyCity/codeofconduct>_
    - _The code of conduct comes from Code for America and was
	  developed by experts, e.g. Valerie Aurora contributed to the
	  Anti-Harassment Policy._
    - _Need to ensure CoC is a continual part of the process. For
      instance, it has never been mentioned since I joined._
- _Scheduling meetings._
- _What type of message to send out._

### Code for Newark
- _Code for Newark seems to be going well. Reach out to Seth Wainer?_

### Technical
- _Try to use non-proprietary technology_
- _Prefer stronger open source licenses, i.e. not MIT, BSD?_
- _Agree on a certain set of technologies for ease of maintenance???_

## Summary of Meeting
- We need a better understanding of the relationship between Code
  for America and a brigade within it.
- We noted that remaining within Code for America provides:
    - Recognition
    - An expert code-of-conduct
- We don't wish to pay people to work on Code for JC projects.
- SRCCON has a good code-of-conduct, https://srccon.org/conduct/
- Working definition of Code for JC mission:
    - _Use tech to give back to the community, and learn from each
      other_
- We recognize people will have different motivates to participate in
  Code for JC. This is fine as long it does not contradict the
  mission, or the code of conduct.
    - Paying people would not be compatible with the mission.
- Plan to meet every two weeks. Initially to work out the mission and
  purpose of the group.
- Short term goal: prepare to open up the meetup again
- Near term goal: hackathon, but not immediately.
    - Hackathon will need a topic with some concrete suggestions for
      projects.
    - This could potentially be hosted at BNYMellon, in JC.
- Plan to invite Brian to present project ideas at a meeting.
- (It is not yet a priority to discuss specific technologies)

## TODO
- Follow up with Brian re. web creds
    - 2017-08-22 09:43 Brian responded
        - The person with the creds is on vacation until the end of the week.
        - Brian is writing a list of potential projects.
- Read about Code for America
- Reach out to Code to Newark
- Speak to anyone else involved in a Code for America brigade
- Read the SRCCON code-of-conduct https://srccon.org/conduct/

## Next meeting
- Discuss further how we will reach out to involve more
  people. E.g. those who have joined the meetup group.
    - In particular, people who are new to Jersey City
