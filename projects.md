#### Dashboard for police "calls for service" data

- Basically anything that police respond do, we need an automated
  analysis tool that lets us view calls on a map, filter by day, week,
  month, and type of call, and that lets us show trends.  Here is a
  static sample but thinking we could take this to the next level-

### Maps

- Existing maps on carto <https://jerseycity.carto.com/maps>

#### Services map

- Need a tool that helps residents and property owners better
  understand services and rules in their neighborhood.  It would allow
  you to type in your address and determine times for garbage and
  recycling pickup, street sweeping, parking zone, political
  ward/voting district, zoning, neighborhood association, elected
  officials, closest firehouse and police station, closest library,
  etc.

#### Map - pedestrian safety elements

#### Map - green infrastructure

- Current map: <https://jerseycity.carto.com/builder/d1fba92c-3ff2-11e7-a71c-0ef24382571b>
- Looking for better functionality to include pictures, and filters
  such as
    - gallons diverted
    - type of project

### Future

#### Jersey City chat bot

- Jersey City chat bot (currently testing
  on <http://www.innovatejerseycity.org>)

#### Online applications

- Online applications (see this zoning approval
  form: <https://seam.ly/PAy26mys>)
